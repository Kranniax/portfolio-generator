# Portfolio-Generator

## Description

A Node.js application that creates an HTML portfolio page from a command line interface. The command line will be used to capture user input and place it in a JavaScript function that provides the finished HTML page as output.

## Requirements

For development, you will only need Node.js and a node global package, Yarn, installed in your environement.

## Installation

- ### Node installation on Windows

  Just go on [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and download the installer.
Also, be sure to have `git` available in your PATH, `npm` might need it (You can find git [here](https://git-scm.com/)).

- #### Node installation on Ubuntu

  You can install nodejs and npm easily with apt install, just run the following commands.

      sudo apt install nodejs
      sudo apt install npm

- #### Other Operating Systems

  You can find more information about the installation on the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/) and the [official NPM website](https://npmjs.org/).

If the installation was successful, you should be able to run the following command.

    $ node --version
    v8.11.3

    $ npm --version
    6.1.0

If you need to update `npm`, you can make it using `npm`! Cool right? After running the following command, just open again the command line and be happy.

    npm install npm -g
